The source code for my Computing and Informatics Capstone course project at Rowan University. 
The project is a group project in which each team member has to collect data from an API,
store the data in a database, and create some website or application that uses the data.

For our project we made a website which displays the top fifty highest rated video games of all time according to the [IGDB API](https://www.igdb.com/api).
Alongside data about each of the games, we retrieved the top five YouTube videos, Bing image search results, and Reddit posts for each game.

## About the Project

Rowan University's C&I Capstone Experience course is the culminating course for Computing and Informatics majors.
The project is divided into four phases:

1. Each member of the team must access an API and collect data around certain topic.
2. The retrieved data then must be parsed, relevant data extracted, and stored in a database.
3. Next, the data has to be put to work. A website or application must be made using the data.
4. Finally, the final product is demoed and presented.
